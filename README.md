# Xenoblade X/2/DE Bdat Editor

A mod of TheAlexBarney's xbtool.
The bdat editor has been massively improved, but other tools are unchanged (and may become out of date)

### Bdat Editor Changes
- Support for Xenoblade X, 2, and DE instead of only 2 (Automatically tries each format when opening a file)
- Arrays are now properly displayed and can be edited
- Flags (boolean) are now properly displayed and can be edited
- UI Improved for better readability and usability
